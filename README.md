### PFA-GAN: Progressive Face Aging with Generative Adversarial Network

[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03459) | [doi](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9309246)

This paper has been accepted as a Regular Paper by **IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics & Security**.

#### Requirements

* PyTorch 1.51+ (Ubuntu, cuda 10.2)
* [Nvidia Apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) (install from source)

#### Training

1. Downloading the datasets.
2. Aligning and generating data using the ages estimated by Face++ APIs.
3. Training with four GPUs on single node:

```shell
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=17674 \\
      main.py --device_ids 0 1 2 3 --source 0
```
4. The pre-trained model is to come.
